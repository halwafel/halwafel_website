			<div style="clear: both;">&nbsp;</div>
			<div class="entry">
			
			<p>Halwafel is a project group composed of four members from the international section of <a href="#">EPITA.</a> 
			This group has been early formed, that is to say almost as soon as we heard about the projects that have to be done for the second semester. 
			Said like that, it may sound like we already knew each others, but it wasn't the case. Indeed, Etienne and Julie were in the same high school but
			did not really know each other and that's it. As time went on, we got to know everyone in our group. Though, Halwafel's members are part of a much larger
			group of friends, the others formed a group by their own and called themselves <a href="http://wetwater.ml/main/">Wet Water</a> (don't ask us why, we have no idea). </p>
			
			<p>At the beginning, we didn't really know what we could do for this project in terms of requirements. We knew the tendency was to take a game and such a choice
			would not have been unanimous, so we decided not to do one. All along the process of finding which project we wanted to do, we
			were also looking for a group name ! Ideas took time to come up, one of the first ones were "Spark" which could give the idea of something that is ready to
			shine, yet inexperienced, still, ready to shine. We didn't all exactly agree to this name, so we decided to get on Discord and agree on something that 
			represents us. Here comes the interesting part: <b><i>How was Halwafel born ?</i></b> The answer is quite simple, from tiredness and hunger, symptoms that sometimes make
			you say weird things like "waffle" in the middle of a conversation for no reason, then being all in the same state it causes a chain reaction, so someone else
			says "half waffle", ending up to some stylized form of this expression: <b>Halwafel</b>.</p>
